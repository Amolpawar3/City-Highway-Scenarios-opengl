# City-Highway-Scenarios-opengl
 this is a opengl project. We tried to implement a city  scenario where we implement some building road and also some cars and buses all the vehicles are moving and there is also a train which can be control by users by clicking some keys (w,a,s) Also we have implemented some mode like day, night and rainy and like before pressing some keys the mode of the scenarios will change and depend on the scenarios the background music will also update â€¦
